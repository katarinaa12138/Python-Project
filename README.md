Katarina Wang, Angela Wong

## User Instructions
1. Navigate and download the files 'main.py', 'command_line.py', and 'create_files.py'.
(Note: Make sure you can navigate the file locations after downloaded.)

2. [Optional] If you don't have files to organize, you can try our program with sample files. Open "create_files.py" in Visual Studio Code, and run the file. You should see a folder named "Sample_Files" created on you desktop. 

3. Open you Command Prompt Terminal on you personal computer.

4. Navigate to the location where you stored you downloaded files from step 1. 
(Note: use 'cd' to navigate through the file system by changing the current working directory.)

5. After setting the working directory, type the command, `python command_line.py [Path to Folder You Want to Organize]`.
Example: 
```Python
python command_line.py C:/Users/cwong3//Desktop/Sample_Files
```

6. Follow the prompts in the terminal to organzie your files.
    - You may choose to organize you files by size, year, or file extensions.
    - You may choose to organize the files one-by-one or move the files all at once. 

7. Your files will be organized into predefined folders!
