# Project Proposal for "File Organizer"
## The Big Idea
The "File Organizer" project is designed to address the common problem of file clutter and disorganization on personal computers. The program uses Python to develop a command-line interface to automate the process of organizing files into pre-defined categories, such as pictures, documents, and video files. By recognizing file types through their extensions, the program streamlines the task of file organization for users, ultimately saving them time and effort.

To achieve this functionality, the project will explore various topics in Python, such as file handling, directory management, and regular expressions. These topics will be leveraged in conjunction with libraries like os and shutil to move files to appropriate folders based on their types. Additionally, the program will include a user interface that simplifies the process of selecting which files to organize and where to move them.

The minimum viable product for this project will include a functional program capable of recognizing and organizing files into pre-defined categories. However, there are several stretch goals that could enhance the program's usability and effectiveness. For example, one stretch goal could be to classify documents into sub-folders based on their content, such as work-related or personal documents. Another stretch goal could be to provide the option for users to confirm or undo file moves, further enhancing the user experience.

Overall, the "File Organizer" project is intended to provide a practical solution for file organization using Python, giving users greater control over their digital files. By automating the process of file organization, the program saves users time and effort, while also exploring several relevant topics in Python and offering a range of features to enhance the user experience.

## Implementation Plan
### Develop Command-Line Interface
>Implement Basic Input/Output Functionality
>>The first subtask of developing the command-line interface is to implement basic input/output functionality. This involves setting up a user prompt and input to accept user commands, and implementing output functionality to display results to the user. Python's built-in input() function can be used to accept user input, while sys.stdout and print() can be used to display output.

>Design Menu Options for User Input
>>To create a user-friendly interface, it is important to design menu options for the user to select from. This involves creating a main menu and submenus for each option, and defining options and input validation rules to ensure that the user input is valid. The curses and cmd modules can be used to create menus and submenus, while argparse can be used to define options and input validation rules.

>Define Functions for Each Menu Option
>>Once the menu options have been designed, it is necessary to write functions to perform specific actions for each option. For example, a function might be created to identify and move files based on their file type. Python's os and shutil modules can be used to perform file operations, such as identifying file types and moving files to appropriate categories.

### Implement File Recognition and Organization Logic
>Identify File Extensions and Types
>>To automate the process of file organization, it is necessary to identify file extensions and types. This can be done using Python's mimetypes module, which maps filename extensions to MIME types. A list of file extensions can be defined for each file type, allowing the program to recognize and categorize files based on their extensions.

>Define Categories for File Organization
>>The next subtask is to define categories for file organization. This involves creating pre-defined categories for organizing files, such as pictures, documents, and video files. The os.path module can be used to create directories and subdirectories for each category. Additionally, the configparser module can be used to allow users to create custom categories.

>>Write Logic to Move Files to Appropriate Categories
Once the file extensions and categories have been defined, it is necessary to write logic to move files to appropriate categories. This can be done using Python's os and shutil modules, which provide functions for moving files and directories. For example, the os.rename() function can be used to move files to a new directory, while shutil.copyfile() can be used to make a copy of a file in a different directory.

### Explore Python Topics
>Study File Handling, Directory Management, and Regular Expressions
>>To develop the "File Organizer" program, it is necessary to explore several relevant topics in Python, such as file handling, directory management, and regular expressions. These topics provide the foundation for the program's functionality, and will be used to automate the process of file organization. Python's os and shutil modules provide functions for file handling and directory management, while the re module can be used to work with regular expressions.

>Learn How to Use the os and shutil Libraries for File Management
>>In addition to studying file handling, it is important to learn how to use the os and shutil libraries for file management. These libraries provide a range of functions for working with files and directories, such as creating and deleting directories, copying and moving files, and listing directory contents. By leveraging the capabilities of these libraries, the "File Organizer" program can be made more efficient and effective.

### Improve User Experience
>Add Ability to Confirm or Undo File Moves
>>To enhance the user experience, it may be helpful to add the ability to confirm or undo file moves. This allows users to preview file moves before they are executed, and to undo moves if necessary. Python's input() function can be used to prompt users to confirm or undo file moves, while the os.rename() function can be used to undo a file move.

>Stretch Goal: Classify Documents into Sub-Folders Based on Content
>>As a stretch goal, it may be possible to classify documents into sub-folders based on their content. This involves using machine learning algorithms to analyze the content of documents and classify them into categories such as work-related or personal documents. Python's scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy libraries can be used to build and train machine learning models for document classification.

### Testing and Debugging
>Test Program with Various File Types and Folder Structures
>>To ensure that the "File Organizer" program works as intended, it is important to test it with various file types and folder structures. This involves creating test cases for different types of files, such as pictures, documents, and video files, and testing the program's ability to recognize and categorize them correctly. The unittest and pytest modules can be used to create and run test cases.

>Debug Any Issues That Arise During Testing
>>During testing, it is possible that issues may arise that require debugging. For example, the program may fail to recognize a particular file type, or it may move files to the wrong category. Python's logging module can be used to log errors and debug messages, making it easier to identify and fix issues.

### Documentation
>Write Clear and Concise Documentation for Program 
>>To make the "File Organizer" program accessible to users, it is important to write clear and concise documentation for its functionality. This involves documenting the program's features and usage, as well as providing examples of input/output and expected results. Tools such as Sphinx, MkDocs, and Read the Docs can be used to generate documentation in various formats, such as HTML and PDF. In addition to documenting the program's functionality, it is important to provide instructions for its use. This includes creating a user guide or manual that explains how to install and run the program, as well as how to use its various features. Sphinx, MkDocs, and Read the Docs can also be used to generate user guides or manuals. To help users understand how to use the "File Organizer" program, it is helpful to provide examples of usage and expected results. This can be done using tools such as doctest, unittest, and pytest, which allow developers to create test cases and examples of usage that can be included in documentation.
